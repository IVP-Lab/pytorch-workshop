## üìã Table of Contents
   1. 

## üì¶ Installing Dependencies
You can install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** This project was developed using Python `v3.12.3`. If you encounter issues running the dependencies or code, consider using this specific Python version.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
   - Open the root folder with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + K` followed by `Ctrl + O`
      - **macOS**: `Cmd + K` followed by `Cmd + O`
   - Open `.ipynb` files using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) extension integrated with VS Code
   - Allow Visual Studio Code to install any recommended dependencies for working with Jupyter Notebooks.
   - Jupyter is integrated with both [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
